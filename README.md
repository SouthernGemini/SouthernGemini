- 👋 Hi, I’m @SouthernGemini but my friends call me Allie!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... A wide variety of technologies, fields, tools and paths with the computer science and sofrware engineering realm. Ranging from Fullstack Web Development to AI and ChatGPT, without forgetting areas like data science and database creation with tools like SQL. Coming from a background as Technical Recruiter for 10 years, I know how to speak the language with all you professionals out there, but I had no idea how to practice what I preached. I wanted to learn how to "walk the walk" now that I knew how to "talk the talk."
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...How to work with RapidAPI and similar tools. I'm almost ready to build my portfolio with Web Dev projects that incorporate React and other tools like Tailwindcss and three.js; paired with website projects that utilize RapidAPI. I'm also finalzing an AI and personalized ChatGPT app as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything I get invited to collaborate on. I have not had the pleasure to work with other developers yet, but hopefully that changes once I get my portfolio up and running. I would also like to start earning a little income as a freelancer.
- 📫 How to reach me... I can be reached via email at either one of my emails {(allison.tulloch@engineer.com) (streetcoding813@gmail.com)}. You can also find me at my LinkedIn which is: (www.linkedin.com/in/allison-tulloch) => {this especially goes for anyone on the job market}; remember, I am a Technical Recruiter that works all tech stack positions but I specialize in the cloud space... My niche within the speciality is AWS DevOps.
