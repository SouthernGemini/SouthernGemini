- 👋 Hi, I’m @SouthernGemini but my friends call me Allie!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... A wide variety of technologies, fields, tools and paths within the computer science and sofrware engineering realm. Ranging from Fullstack Web Development to AI and ChatGPT, without forgetting areas like data science and database creation with tools like SQL. Coming from a background as Technical Recruiter for 10 years, I know how to speak the language with all you professionals out there, but I had no idea how to practice what I preached.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...How to work with RapidAPI and similar tools. ThreeJS and React-Three-Dreu are fascinating to me and utlizing tools like blender and Unity along with it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything I get invited to collaborate on. I have not had the pleasure to work with other developers, but hopefully that changes soon. I would also like to start earning a little income as a freelancer.
- 📫 How to reach me... I can be reached via email at either one of my emails {(allison.tulloch@engineer.com) (streetcoding813@gmail.com)}. You can also find me at my LinkedIn which is: (www.linkedin.com/in/allison-tulloch) => {this especially goes for anyone on the job market}; remember, I am a Technical Recruiter that works all tech stack positions with specializations in the cloud space...
